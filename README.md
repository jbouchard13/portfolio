# My Portfolio

### What it is

    For this project I had to create a portfolio page that responds to varying device sizes.
    I used bootstrap and it's grid system to create an organized page that will change the size and 
    alignment of the different divs displayed.
    For anything larger than a small screen everything should display horizontally if applicable.
    For smaller handheld devices there is a breakpoint of 576px which makes everything align vertically.

### Features

    On my page you will find an about me section with an included picture.
    By navigating the links in the navbar you will find a portfolio page with links to some of my completed work.
    From there the user can check out the deployed apps or the repositories for each application.
    There is also a footer on the page with icons that link to my various social media accounts.
    If the user goes to the contact page they can see direct links to my social media accounts as well.
