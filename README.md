# My Portfolio

### What it is

    For this project I had to create a portfolio page that responds to varying device sizes.
    I used bootstrap and it's grid system to create an organized page that will change the size and 
    alignment of the different divs displayed.
    For anything larger than a small screen everything should display horizontally if applicable.
    For smaller handheld devices there is a breakpoint of 576px which makes everything align vertically.

### Features

    On my page you will find an about me section with an included picture.
    By navigating the links in the navbar you will find a portfolio page filled with placeholder text and images.
    At the moment where I don't have any completed projects I have nothing to put into these spots.
    As time goes on these spots will be filled with actual links to projects I've worked on.
    On the contact page you'll find links to a few of my social media platforms.
    As well as an email link that will prompt you to send me an email.
